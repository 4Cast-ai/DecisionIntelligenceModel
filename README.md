|Component|Description|Notes|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|**4Cast Platform**|An advanced DSS system based on a unique methodology that supports a variety of markets, organizations, and scenarios. It provides tools for analyzing organizational [readiness](#readiness) and recommendations for actions based on suitable [models](#model).   ||
|**BackEnd**|This is the core of the [4Cast Platform](#platform). The module in the platform where the [models](#model), [activities](#Activity), [forms](#Forms), and [tags](#TAG) are created. The Backend module enables easy integration to external platforms by using API’s interface.||
|**Model**|<p>A model is an entire decision analysis method for analyzing metrics and [KPIs](#KPI) in a variety of business applications, including analysis, forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulation.** It’s a framework that supports decision making. Each model is linked to an [entity](#Entity) in the system and it’s built of three core layers:</p><p>- **Data –** [Attributes](#Attribute), [metrics](#METRIC), and [KPI’s](#KPI) organized into a tree model.</p><p>- **Analysis –** Analysis of data, incidents/event scenarios, forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulation (i.e. run scenario 1000x in 1 hr) to predict the probability of different outcomes.</p><p>- **Recommendations –** A list of alternative courses of action provided to decision-makers based upon their responsibilities before, during, and/or after disasters.</p><p></p>||
|**KPI**|Key performance indicators refer to a group of [metrics](#METRIC) used to define overall long-term performance.||
|**Metric**|<p>Measuring unit for assessing and tracking [entity](#Entity), [skill](#Skill), or [performance](#Performance). </p><p>Metric is the basic measurement unit on the [4Cast Platform](#platform).</p><p>The metric’s data can be brought from several resources such as source systems (e.g. CRM, ERP, etc.), IoT, filling out forms on the [4Cast Platform](#platform), and more.</p><p></p>|<p>There are several types of metrics on the 4Cast platform:</p><p>- Percentage- (0%-100%)</p><p>- Numerical</p><p>- Binary</p><p>- Qualitative- (scale 1-5 and 1-7)</p><p></p>|
|**Attribute**|Attributes are immutable characteristics of someone or something.||
|**Threshold**|Emphasis of a critical component in the [model](#model). Any change in this component will drastically affect the entire model.||
|**Entity**|An entity represents a specific person (e.g. employee, soldier, etc.) or unit (e.g. a business unit, a military unit, etc.). A competency model is linked to the unique entity sets.||
|**Tag**|<p>A term assigned to a group of [entities](#Entity), which then links them to [models](#model) and [activities](#Activity) within the system.</p><p>For example – all firefighters will receive the tag “firefighters” and this tag will automatically connect them to the firefighter [model](#model) and to relevant [activities](#Activity) for firefighters.</p><p>The tag helps to manage and control the connections between [Entities](#Entity)-[models](#model)-[activities](#Activity) in the system and ensures that each [entity](#Entity) receives relevant [models](#model) and [activities](#Activity). </p>||
|**Activity type**|Enables development of suitable activities for each entity in the organization according to the entity’s needs.|E.g. training, learning, performance management, inspections, etc.|
|**Form type**|Enables the creation of forms for every activity for an entity with the relevant metrics. Each form is linked to relevant activity(ies).||
|**Skill**|The ability to do something that comes from training, experience, or practice. The skill is typically represented in the [4Cast Platform](#platform) by a [metric](#METRIC) or [KPI](#KPI).||
|**Competence**|The ability required to do something well or accomplish an objective. The competence is typically represented by a [model](#model) in the [4Cast Platform](#platform).||
|**Performance**|How well an entity performs its actions that affect its [competence](#Comprtrnce). The performance is typically represented by a report in the [4Cast Platform](#platform).||
|**Readiness**|Willingness or the state of being prepared for something. ||
|**Diversity [^1]**|Acknowledging, understanding, accepting, valuing, and respecting the variety of characteristics that make individuals unique. ||
|**Equity [^2]**|The consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals.||
|**Inclusion[^3]**|The act or practice of including and accommodating people who have historically been excluded (as because of their race, gender, sexuality, or ability).||
